# TicTacToe_Game_Server

## project statement

*This project is a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game using socket programming in C++ in which a server creates the game in a local area network. The players in LAN can connect to the server by using the IP address of the server. We will be using the concept of multi-threading. When a new connection arrives, a new thread will be created. To avoid race-condition between threads we will implement the concept of the mutex. There will be many instances of the game running concurrently.*
